          Blazer Low x sacai Chitose Abe approaches collaborations with a
          distinct clarity, looking to forge a genuine connection that allows
          for something new and unexpected. Her method is a dichotomy in and
          of itself, mixing time-tested stability with explorational risk.
          Abe's aim is to honor the familiar while ushering in the new. At the
          direction of Abe and her sacai label, this design reimagines the
          Blazer by chopping the classic silhouette. The collaboration
          features a leather upper with exposed foam liners, as well as
          sacai's signature stacked tongues and double lacing. A neutral base
          contrasts with bold accents inspired by original Blazer colorways.

          Michael Jordan's title-winning classic returns in a sleek makeup
          furthering the sneaker’s heritage and charting a new path for its
          future. Always identifiable by its unique rising sun-inspired stitch
          lines and quilted-like upper, the Air Jordan 12 "Utility" takes a
          purposeful and pragmatic design approach. The outsole is composed of
          3% Nike Grind materials, which are made from recycled scrap and
          end-of-life shoes. From there, a utilitarian inspiration was born
          out by finishes like a ballistic mesh tongue, a premium nubuck
          leather mudguard, and a premium leather upper.

          The colorway, which has been dormant since its 2006 release, is
          rumored to finally arrive, according to Sole Heat On Feet. The
          return lines up with Jordan Brand’s commitment to bringing an entire
          slate of Air Jordan 4s starting with the “Fire Red” in 2020 all the
          way to 2021. While confirmation is still up in the air for the
          “Lightning” release, our hopes are high this time around.

          It's the rare sneaker that satisfies the "rule of three"—sometimes,
          having three minds is greater than one. In the case of Jordan Brand,
          Travis Scott, and Hiroshi Fujiwara's Fragment Design, it was a case
          of three masterminds coming together to collaborate on not just any
          Air Jordan, but the beloved Air Jordan 1—a model both the Houston
          rapper and the Japanese designer have tapped for past Jordan Brand
          link-ups. Their Air Jordan 1 Low colorway comes in familiar color
          blocking schemes, but with special touches only Scott and Fujiwara
          could've conjured up. On top of an aged midsole with matching Sail
          laces, fresh Military Blue accents the heel, collar and insole,
          providing a new flavor for a classic makeup. And no need for
          double-takes at the Sail Swoosh—it's indeed backwards—now a
          signature Scott touch for his Air Jordan 1 designs. But if anyone on
          the street rubbernecks while you're rocking this collab, they'll
          know who’s responsible: Cactus Jack and Fragment Design logos are
          embossed on the left and right heels respectively, leaving their
          modern marks on this time-tested silhouette.

          Air Jordan 1 High OG "Pollen"
        </h2>
        <p>
          More than 35 years after its debut, the Air Jordan 1 still stands as
          a timeless and versatile design built to match any aesthetic. It's
          the perfect silhouette to support the "Pollen" makeup—no allergies
          to worry about here. In a classic OG color blocking scheme, leather
          Pollen overlays buzz against a tumbled Black leather underlay. Its
          clean white midsole completes the style without getting the
          sniffles.
